          I am currently a student at <span id="bold-text">CUNY Queens College</span> pursuing 
          a Bachelors in Computer Science. I've been based in <span id="bold-text">NYC</span> my whole 
          life and grew up in <span id="bold-text">Harlem</span>. My goal is to one day become a full time
          Game Developer that creates inspiring and revolutionary games. <br> <br>
          Growing up I've always loved playing games with family and freinds and enjoyed the fact
          that it can bring people together. As I developed, I appricated the impact that some games
          can have on a person and the message they can have. I also can appricate how much 
          effort can be poured into every single aspect of a game; from the art, to the mechanics, to 
          even the audio. I've come across many different forms of media which have inpired me to 
          try and to the same for others.
