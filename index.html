    <p style="width: 500px;" id="bg_normal">
      I am currently a student at <span id="bold-text">CUNY Queens College</span> pursuing 
      a Bachelors in Computer Science. I've been based in <span id="bold-text">NYC</span> 
      my whole life and grew up in <span id="bold-text">Harlem</span>. My goal is to one day 
      become a full time Game Developer that creates inspiring and revolutionary games. <br> <br> 
      Growing up I've always loved playing games with family and friends and enjoyed the fact that 
      it can bring people together. As I developed, I appreciated the impact that some games can 
      have on a person and the message they can have. I also can appreciate how much effort can 
      be poured into every single aspect of a game; from the art, to the mechanics, to even the 
      audio. I've come across many different forms of media which have inspired me to try and do 
      the same for others.

        This is my first game made using the Unreal Engine 5. 
        It is a minigame loosely based on a Kirby minigame in 
        which you have to beat your opponent by pressing a button first. 
        Most of the assets were taken from a guide that I was following, 
        except for the bottom left character (The one you play as), 
        which was made by me. He is based off a "One Piece" character 
        and his name is Zoro.

        This is my very first game on GoDot. 
        I carefully followed a tutorial by YouTuber Brackeys 
        to help dive into the world of GoDot. After going over the 
        basics for this game, I was able to fully customize the level
        design. This helped with my understanding of level creation
        and how some very minute details can effect how the player plays like, 
        getting the hit boxes and collision boxed just right so that there isn't any
        strange bugs going on, or play testing each part of the level so that
        the player has the best experience (but in this case the most frustrating one).
        All assets were pulled from his video "How to make a video game"
